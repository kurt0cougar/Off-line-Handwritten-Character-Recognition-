# Off-line-Handwritten-Character-Recognition-
A prototype of an Off-line Handwritten Character Recognition 

Trained on 28000 examples from the IAM-word dataset, validated on 8400 and tested on 3600.

It is built from a CRNN architecture, with a CTC(Connectionist Temporal Classification) loss and decoder.

After training for 30 epochs, the training loss: 4.2730 - val_loss: 5.1883.

Character Error Rate: 20.68% |  Word Accuracy: 55.67%
